This program runs on the files listed below, included as well are tester files. 

Gibberisher class's goal is to generate random, pronounceable, English words. It takes the English dictionary, and summarizes it into a tree structure of 3-letter word segments, associated with a Charbag (abstract data type). In each charbag is a frequency distribution for each letter of the alphabet. After modeling the tree structure, we now have a reusable way to represent a language. Gibberisher then generates words, accessing the model's child class


Files required for operation:
~ CharBag.java
~ CharBagTest.java
~ Dictionary.java (or your own language/dictionary)
~ Gibberisher.java
~ GibberisherMain.java
~ LetterSample.java
~ Trie.java
~ TrieNode.java
